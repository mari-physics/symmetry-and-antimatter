Symmetry and Antimatter

Author: Mariem Mostafa
Field: Theoretical and Mathematical Physics
Project Type: LaTeX-based academic exploration

#Overview

This project explores the concept of **symmetry** and the **matter–antimatter asymmetry** in the universe.
It represents an early attempt to connect mathematical reasoning with fundamental physical questions about why our universe favors matter over antimatter.

#Content

* `main.tex`: LaTeX source file containing the mathematical and conceptual framework.
* `main.pdf`: Compiled document illustrating the final structured report.

#Tools Used

* [Overleaf] - for LaTeX editing and compilation
* [GitHub] — for version control and open sharing

#Purpose

This repository serves as the foundation for future studies in **theoretical physics**, with a focus on symmetry, particle behavior, and the deep mathematical principles underlying physical laws.
